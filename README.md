# Svelte & Storybook Component Library

Creating a component library utilizing Svelte and Storybook.  And learning them both as I go :)

## What is used
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/)
- [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [BEM](http://getbem.com/)
- [Svelte Notifications](https://github.com/beyonk-adventures/svelte-notifications)

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-storybook--component-library
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

...to run StoryBook:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

## Staging site

## Known issues
- Toast notifications - Make more dynamic by consolodating into a single component with props handling the Toast type.
- Work to resolve warnings in console.
